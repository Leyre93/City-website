        <h1>About Valencia</h1>
        <h2>Valencia is a city located on Spain's southeastern coast, where the Turia River meets the Mediterranean Sea.</h2>
        <p>Valencia is the third-most populated municipality in Spain, with 791,413 inhabitants. It is known for its City of Arts and Sciences, with futuristic structures such as a planetarium, an oceanarium and an interactive museum. Valencia also has several beaches, including some within nearby Albufera Park, a wetlands reserve with a lake and walking trails.</p>
        <p>The city's port is the 5th-busiest container port in Europe and the busiest container port on the Mediterranean Sea. The city is ranked as a Gamma-level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Its historic centre is one of the largest in Spain.</p>
        <p>Due to its long history, Valencia has numerous celebrations and traditions, such as "las Fallas", a local festival held in March and declared National Tourist of Interest of Spain in 1965 and an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in November 2016. Joan Ribó from Compromís has been the mayor of the city since 2015.</p>

           <h1>History</h1>
           <p>Valencia is one of the oldest cities in Spain, founded in the Roman period, under the name "Valentia Edetanorum". A few centuries later, the Catholic Church assumed the reins of power in the city, coinciding with the first waves of the invading Germanic people. In protohistoric times, the area now occupied by the city of Valencia consisted of lagoons and flood plains, on which tribes or families engaged in fishing are thought to have settled. The very large lake, of which La Albufera is a present-day vestige, presumably skirted the high ground surrounding the cathedral, and it was there that a lakeside city, initially built on stilts and subsequently consisting of huts, came into being.</p>
           <p>During the first century A.D., Valencia re-emerged and became larger than it had been before its destruction, which had place during the epic struggle between Sertorius and Pompey the Great. The economy of Muslim Valencia, based on agriculture, started to grow in the 11th century under the Moors. This period coincided with the reign of Abd al Aziz, who was instrumental in building the Arab surrounding walls. The city inside the walls was typically Islamic, with its narrow winding streets and a large number of "atzucacs", or blind alleys. The conquest of the city of Valencia by James I of Aragon in September 1238 gave rise to a fundamental change of style in its development.</p>
           <p>One major cultural event was the creation of the university, which was established in 1498 in the south-east corner of the former Jewish quarter. In the 16th century, the outstanding feature of Valencia was the large number of religious foundations, which changed the face of the city. In the same century, the city was marked by a severe economic depression largely caused by the expulsion of the Moors. In the first half of the 18th century, Valencia lost its charter when it was occupied by the Bourbons. There was a short period of economic depression, during which changes in the urban fabric were made primarily for military reasons. From 1808 to 1874, the city was altered and remodelled in three stages. The early years of the 20th century witnessed a period of agricultural and commercial development. In the years that followed, uncontrolled building had an adverse impact on the growth of the city and affected its urban planning. The historic centre is currently the focus for an important rehabilitation operation involving the drafting of specific planning proposals and direct investment.</p>
